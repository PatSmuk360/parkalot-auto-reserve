# parkalot-auto-reserve
Simple script I made to automatically reserve my parking spot

## Installation
`npm i -g https://github.com/snypelife/parkalot-auto-reserve.git` will install the binary into your global modules.

It uses puppeteer, which can take a bit to download. It's worth it though, I swear!

## Usage
`parkalot-reserve <username> <password>`, and it will automatically install dependencies, and reserve your spot.
